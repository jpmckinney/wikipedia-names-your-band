h1. Wikipedia Names Your Band

A little application I wrote to help teach myself a bit about "Google App Engine":http://code.google.com/appengine/. It fetches all the pieces you need to make a random album cover according to the "Wikipedia Names Your Band" "meme":http://www.buzzfeed.com/peggy/wikipedia-names-your-band.

It uses jQuery to send requests to the "Wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php and "Flickr":http://www.flickr.com/services/api/, "is.gd":http://is.gd/api_info.php, and "Picnik":http://www.picnik.com/info/api APIs. I also learnt just enough Python to write a simple proxy <tt>fetch.py</tt>, since "The Quotations Page":http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3 doesn't have an API, and I can't fetch its HTML directly with jQuery without getting an "Access to restricted URI denied" exception.

I ran into some gotchas on Google App Engine. No Python library with C extensions is available, so <tt>lxml</tt> and others are out. Of the libraries that do run on Google App Engine, <tt>html5lib</tt> seems to be the only one that doesn't choke on malformed HTML (did you know that inline JavaScript must be in a CDATA(character data) section for the HTML to validate?). Also, App Engine caches the results of <tt>urllib2.urlopen</tt>, so if you are going to request a dynamic page often, put a random number in the query string to get around App Engine's aggressive caching.
